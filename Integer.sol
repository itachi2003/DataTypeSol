// Integer (int, uint)
// Signed (int) and unsigned (uint) integers, declared in increments of 8 bits from int8 to uint 256.
// Without a size suffix, 256-bit quantities are used, to match the word size of the EVM

Signed Integers (int):

int8: Represents a signed integer with a size of 8 bits (-128 to 127).
int16: Represents a signed integer with a size of 16 bits (-32,768 to 32,767).
int32: Represents a signed integer with a size of 32 bits (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647).
int64: Represents a signed integer with a size of 64 bits (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807).
int128: Represents a signed integer with a size of 128 bits.
int256: Represents a signed integer with a size of 256 bits.
